# philosophy
A compilation of my observations on recurring coding patterns and encountered problems

_"Coding philosophy encompasses the guiding principles, values, and best practices that shape how developers approach coding, design software, and collaborate on projects. It's about more than just writing code; it's about thinking critically about the implications of one's code and how it impacts the world.

_"Programming is not just about writing code, itâ€™s a systematical way of reasoning."_ - [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-philosophy-of-programming-e901bd37363a/)

### functions
