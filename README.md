# philosophy
A compilation of my observations on recurring coding patterns and encountered problems

_"Coding philosophy encompasses the guiding principles, values, and best practices that shape how developers approach coding, design software, and collaborate on projects. It's about more than just writing code; it's about thinking critically about the implications of one's code and how it impacts the world.

_"Programming is not just about writing code, itâ€™s a systematical way of reasoning."_ - [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-philosophy-of-programming-e901bd37363a/)

## philosophies that I strongly follow

The Unix Philosophy, which I use as Guidance.

    Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
    Write programs to work together.
    Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface. (json/yaml/tsv)

## systematic ways of solving a problems

...

## dealing with collections

Common problem I have in my life is the management of collections of objects. (birthdays, contacts, tasks, bills, vehicles, documents, etc.) mention of "managers"

### object modelling

topics: identification, uuid, yaml, json, csv, tsv, csv vs. tsv, 

## how I name my things

### directories and files

Instead of 'wifi-bill-june-2024.pdf', `bills/2024/06/wifi.pdf` or `bills/wifi/2024/06.pdf` or `bills.2024.06.pdf` if dirs are not an option. I called it the hierarchical method.
